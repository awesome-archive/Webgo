I spent about 10 hours to utilize chart.js to show winrate curve.
The final result is 90% satisfied which I plan to use in Webgo project to show winrate and dynamic komi difference.
Still one remain issue, I can't show vertical line or called index line when finger touch on the graph. But I've already found some materials to resolve it.
